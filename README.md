To use this program:

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system. If not, you can download it at [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Make sure that Python is part of your PATH variables. To test this, open up a command prompt with `Win + R`, then enter cmd. If you type "python -V" or "python3 -V", you should see the version number.
3. Install pip by running `python -m ensurepip`.
4. Navigate to the directory you downloaded the code to, then run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies for the program.
5. Then run python3 main.py`.
